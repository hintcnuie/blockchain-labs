# Blockchain Labs

This set of tutorial labs will introduce you to the Hyperledger blockchain technology.

The [Intro lab](./docs/lab-intro-v1.md) shows you how to set up your machine and install the pre-requisites.

[Lab 1](./docs/lab1-v1.md): create a simple Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network on your machine, running in Docker containers.

[Lab 2](./docs/lab2-v1.md): download and install a simple chaincode into the blockchain network, query it and invoke a transaction.

[Lab 3](./docs/lab3-v1.md): set up Hyperledger Composer Playground, and deploy a business network to the blockchain.

[Lab 4](./docs/lab4-v1.md): set up the Hyperledger Composer REST Server to expose the business network as an API, and generate a starter app using Yeoman.

[Lab 5](./docs/lab5-v1.md): set up a prototyping environment, use the  Hyperledger Composer CLI to build and deploy a business network, and explore a Node.js example app.

[Lab 6](./docs/lab6-v1.md): modify the business network and example app to suit your customer's requirements.

[Lab 7](./docs/lab7-v1.md): deploy Hyperledger to IBM Container Service on Bluemix using Kubernetes.

[Lab 8](./docs/lab8-v1.md): deploy Composer Playground, Composer REST Server, and your app, to Bluemix.

[Lab 9](./docs/lab9-v1.md): use OpenWhisk to trigger actions in your Hyperledger business network on Bluemix.

[Lab 10](./docs/lab10-v1.md): use Node-RED to respond to events in your Hyperledger business network.
